# DF Cinemas Hackathon
Hackathon Part 1 - HTML & CSS

Hackathon Part 2 - JavaScript

## Overview
DF Cinemas has approached us to create a modern looking website promoting their cinemas. In the first iteration, they would like to be able to provide their customers with general information about their cinemas, schedule and opening hours and allow them to subscribe to receive some promotional materials.

The business representatives have worked with our UI/UX team and they have created the following low fidelity mock-ups. They understand that their customers view their pages on different devices and want us to accommodate to this. The site will be split into three pages â€“

- home page with information about the Cinemas;

- a 'schedule' page displaying opening hours and movies showing this week;

- a 'signup' page to gather some information about the user.

The navigation between the pages should be easy and straightforward, with a navigation bar on top of each page.


## User Stories
The User Stories have been prioritised and ordered:
```
